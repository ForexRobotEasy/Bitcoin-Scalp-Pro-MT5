## How It Works
The trading robot follows a systematic approach to execute its trading strategy. Here is a high-level overview of the main functions and their purpose:

1. `CalculateParameters()` - This function calculates adaptive parameters such as stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stop-loss, entries, and lot size based on the current price. You can customize the calculation logic according to your trading strategy.

2. `AdjustParameters()` - This function adjusts the parameters based on market conditions. You can add your own logic to determine how the parameters should be adjusted.

3. `TradeBreakouts()` - This function performs breakout trading based on support and resistance levels. You can implement your breakout trading strategy in this function.

4. `PerformBacktests()` - This function performs backtests with 99.90% tick quality to ensure accurate results. You can add your own backtesting logic here.

5. `EnsureSafety()` - This function ensures safety by minimizing drawdowns and maintaining a favorable risk/reward ratio. You can customize the safety measures according to your risk management strategy.

6. `ComplyWithBestPractices()` - This function ensures compliance with industry best practices. You can add your own best practices compliance logic here.

7. `TestAndFixBugs()` - This function is responsible for testing and fixing any bugs or issues in the code. You can add your own testing and bug fixing logic here.

8. `DeliverFinalCode()` - This function delivers the final code within the specified timeframe. You can customize the code delivery logic according to your requirements.

9. `ProvideDocumentation()` - This function provides documentation on how to use and configure the EA. You can add your own documentation logic here.

10. `CollaborateWithProjectTeam()` - This function is responsible for collaborating with the project team and ensuring a smooth development process. You can customize the collaboration logic according to your team's workflow.

11. `MaintainCommunication()` - This function maintains regular communication and provides progress updates. You can add your own communication logic here.

12. `AddressFeedback()` - This function addresses feedback and modifications promptly. You can add your own feedback addressing logic here.
